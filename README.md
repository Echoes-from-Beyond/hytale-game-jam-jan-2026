# Scrapvengers 

*Scrapvengers* is a simple tower defense/colony sim game made in 4 days for [the Hytale Modjam](https://hytalemodjam.com/).

Survive in the fallen magitech metropolis of the Crucible; fend off hostile automatons, and gather enough resources to repair a broken radio tower so that you can shut down the city's overactive defenses. Managing your resources carefully is critical. If you run out of colonists or your tower is destroyed, you lose!

This mod probably won't work with others installed, as it makes the rest of the game inaccessible due to transporting you straight into the colony sim. It _might_ work with multiple players... but do so at your own risk :)
